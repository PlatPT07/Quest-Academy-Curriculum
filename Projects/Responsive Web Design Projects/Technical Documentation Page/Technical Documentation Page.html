                        <p>Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was
                                created by
                                Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and
                                clear syntax, which
                                makes it accessible even to those who are new to programming.</p>

                                development. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP is especially suited for

                                scripting, meaning it runs on a web server to generate dynamic web pages.</p>
